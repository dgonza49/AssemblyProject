# AssemblyProject
This program was written in Visual Studios. 
Run the program in that environment.
Note: Running this program through dosbox or another emulator
may require more advanced setup. 

The program is a Calculator written in Assembly language, 
specifically MASM. 
I utilitze the Irvine32 Library provided by textbook:
7th or 8th Edition of Assembly Language for x86 Processors

A breakdown of the environment needed to 
compile can be found on this website:
