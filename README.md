# AssemblyProject
This program was written in Visual Studios so it is
recommended that the setup be using Visaul Studios.
Running this program through dosbox or another emulator
may require more advance setup. 

The program is Calculate written in Assembly language 
sepcifically MASM. 
I utilitze the Irvine32 Library provived by textbook:
7th or 8th Edition of Assembly Language for x86 Processors

A breakdown of the environment and setup needed to 
compile can be found on this website:
